The overall prognosis of NSCLC is poor with low 5-year survival rates. Recent advances suggest that malignancy NSCLC cancers are the cancer stem cell (CSC) diseases. The stemness potentials of CSC with epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation ensure their invasion and disseminate to metastsis organs. The self-renewal property of CSC mediates intrinsic drug resistance to cytotoxicity therapy and promoted aggressive relapse tumour. Metabolic reprogramming on bioenergetics of malignant cancer cells has been proposed as the key mediator in the stemness CSC development. Malignancy cells uptake glucose for fermented glycolysis to produce lactate which release resulted in acidified microenvironment to trigger the mTOR and sonic hedgehog metabolic stress signaling in supporting CSC stemness potentials. The metabostemness of cancer cells is the new-dimensional hallmark of malignancy tumour, which may serve as the diagnostic markers for the early detection of malignancy cancers. Folate-mediated one carbon metabolism coordinates glucose into amino acid metabolism to tailor the fuel metabolites in supporting macromolecule synthesis and to sustain the bioenergetics requirement. Acting as the metabolic stressor, low folate intake is associated with increased risks of lung cancers. Folate and one-carbon nutrient status of NSCLC patients in Taiwan, however, has not been assessed. The role of low folate metabolic stress (LFMS) in metabostemness marker and metastasis potentials of malignancy NSCLC is unexplored.

The 5-year overall survival is less than 10% for the 2/3 of the patients, which are not considered resectable. Even for the 1/3, which is treated with surgical intervention and neoadjuvant chemotherapy the overall-survival is approximately 30%.||The current Danish intended curative treatment consists of esophagectomy (surgical resection of the oesophagus with extended lymphadenectomy in abdomen and thorax (removal of lymphnodes)). Furthermore, perioperative chemotherapy consists of 6 series neoadjuvant chemotherapy (3 series before, and 3 series after operation).||Unresectable patients receive palliative chemotherapy and no resection. Peritoneal washing cytology (PWC) is a recommended prediagnostic modality in gastric cancer patients. The method is used to detect free peritoneal cancer cells in the abdominal cavity even when macroscopic carcinomatosis is not present (i.e. the cancer has spread to other parts of the abdomen).||Carcinomatosis can be found in up to 19% in gastric cancer patients often in the peritoneum. Positive peritoneal cytology (C1) can be identified in up to 7% of gastric cancer patients without metastases (C1M0), i.e. malignant cells can be identified in the peritoneal washing, but tumor spread has not been identified.||Lots of studies indicate that C1-disease is an independent prognostic predictor for decreased survival, and increased recurrence rate, comparable with M1 patients (i.e. patients with distant metastases).||The American Joint Committee on cancer recommends that C1 patients should be treated non-surgically - even when M1 disease has not been identified.||On the basis of the above, PWC can be used to identify patients at greater risk for recurrence, and thereby not candidates for intended curative treatment.||It is a fact, though, that C1M0 patients have a better survival than C1M1 patients. Currently, there is no level-1 evidence for specific treatment of C1M0 patients, why further research is required to approach this patient group in the most comprehensive way. The focus group of our study is therefore C1M0 patients, because of the difference in opinions. Furthermore most evidence is based on gastric carcinomas, why GEJ-cancer patients are the group, we will examine.||Purpose:||Peritoneal washing cytology (PWC) is performed as a standard prediagnostic modality at Rigshospitalet, for patients with gastric- and GEJ cancer, considered resectable at preceding multidisciplinary conference. Most studies in the past 20-years have focused on gastric cancer, and not specifically GEJ-cancer.||This study will determine the usefulness of peritoneal washing cytology, and thereby verifying our own standard regarding GEJ-cancer. Furthermore, we will determine the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on free peritoneal tumor cells and its correlation with overall survival.||This study is intended as a validation of our own standard."

In addition, if it is found to be late, there is a possibility of invading surrounding tissues and metastasis, so that it is impossible to cure. Therefore, early diagnosis and early surgery and benign and malignant differentiation of small nodules are the key to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.At present, second-generation gene sequencing (NGS) and liquid biopsy are rarely reported in the field of GIST. A few domestic and foreign studies have found that it can detect rare mutation types, and may find secondary gene mutations early, which has potential applicability, but Overall, the clinical guidance of these NGS-based studies focuses on prognosis and drug resistance , as well as some studies based on low-throughput platforms.

Unfortunately, there is no standardized and evidence-based treatment for malignant ascites and therapies which are commonly being used are only temporarily effective. Newer modes of therapy, such as the application of the tri-functional antibody catumaxomab, are associated with significant side effects and are limited to patients in stages of good overall performance. Therefore, there is still an urgent need for more effective, longer-lasting, and less toxic modes of treatment for peritoneal effusions caused by gastrointestinal cancers.||Preclinical data strongly suggest that bevacizumab might be a very effective agent for the treatment of malignant ascites, which is in large part caused by the hyperpermeability-promoting factor VEGF. Emerging clinical results from cancer patients with malignant ascites treated with bevacizumab add further support to this idea. Bevacizumab has been tested in a variety of large clinical trials, has a good toxicity profile, and is effective in a number of human cancers underlying malignant ascites.||In the present study, Bevacizumab will be administered as an intraperitoneal infusion at an absolute standardized dosage of 400 mg.

During the treatment an ultrasound transducer generates and focuses ultrasound energy to a focal point, called a sonication. The sonication raises the tissue temperature within a well-defined region to a degree, which causes thermal coagulation.

Over 10000 new cases per year are diagnosed in Taiwan. Despite the many treatment options, the prognosis of HCC remains dismal. More than 8000 people died of this cancer every year in Taiwan. A majority (70%to 85%) of patients present with advanced or unresectable disease. In contrast, small liver cancers can be cured with an appreciable frequency. Five-year disease-free survival exceeding 50% has been reported for surgical resection, and for the inoperable patients who do not have vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is recommended as an alternative curative therapy. However, the main drawback of RFA is its limitation to tumor size and location. The tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter or located adjacent to vessels, could not be ablated completely.||Irreversible electroporation (IRE), developed and manufactured by AngioDynamics US Ltd, can ablate tumor by fenestrating the cancer cell membrane by electric pulse. The anti-tumor effect does not result from thermotherapy, so is also not diminished by adjacent vessels. Several pre-clinical studies have already demonstrated IRE is a safe and effective treatment for live cancers. The system has received CE mark approval in 2008 and FDA approval in 2010. However, there is no experience in using IRE fro tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this study, the investigators will perform intraoperative IRE for the patients with liver cancers who are scheduled to receive hepatectomy in our hospital, and the investigators will evaluate the ablate effect of tumors on specimens, and the effect of adjacent vessels.

It gives excellent morphological information but does not reflect the metabolic activity leading to high proportion of false positive results. PET-CT fulfills this gap but suffers from low resolution and the risk of radiation damage. Lately, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI of glucose has been proposed as a new molecular imaging approach for diagnosing tumors given its high sensitivity at the molecular level and the known enhanced glucose uptake by tumors. Several glucose analogs were examined as possible candidates for imaging of breast tumors. One of the most promising agent for CEST-MRI is glucosamine (GlcN); owing to its phosphorylated products that accumulate in breast tumors, it enables to reflect their metabolic profile. In preclinical experiments glucosamine exhibits enhanced CEST signals in 4T1 and MCF7 implanted breast cancer cells in mice. Its potential for the human clinical application is strengthened by its lack of toxicity. Here the investigators propose to test the method for human subjects on a clinical MRI setup. The goal of this study is to develop innovative molecular imaging modality based on CEST-MRI of GlcN for the detection of breast tumors.

There are many risk factors that affect the occurrence and death of cardiovascular diseases and malignant tumors. In addition to genetic and congenital factors, it also includes bad lifestyles, such as smoking, drinking, abnormal metabolism, excessive stress, etc. Many factors such as excessive stress and staying up late can cause abnormal circadian rhythms. The regulation of circadian rhythm is likely to be a key key to the early prevention of cardiovascular diseases and tumors.||Melatonin has an important role in regulating the circadian rhythm of the human body. The latest research of our research group confirmed that melatonin can reduce the level of oxidative stress through the retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor alpha (RORα) and thereby inhibit pathological cardiac hypertrophy; melatonin can regulate the polarization and polarization of macrophages RORα receptor stabilizes vulnerable plaque in arteries and prevents plaque rupture.||In China, melatonin is widely used in the market as a health product. However, the protective mechanism of melatonin in cardiovascular diseases and tumors is still unclear, and large-scale population intervention studies are still lacking. The level of melatonin in the daytime changes little with age, but the peak at night gradually decreases with age. In people aged 60 and above, the peak of melatonin at night decreased significantly. We speculate that melatonin supplementation may be able to reduce the oxidative damage of mitochondria by maintaining the level of melatonin at night in the body, delay cell decay, and delay this physiological process.||Therefore, the project team intends to combine the developed new cardiovascular disease and tumor risk prediction models in the Shanghai elderly cohort established in the early stage, and randomize groups of healthy people in the same risk stratification, according to whether or not to supplement melatonin. There are two cohorts: the melatonin intervention cohort and the parallel control cohort. By observing the efficacy indicators of cardiovascular disease and tumor incidence in the two groups during the follow-up period, it provides evidence-based medical evidence for the future clinical application of melatonin."

Advantages of albumin-bound paclitaxel Paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding type) uses human serum albumin (HAS) as a carrier, and paclitaxel and HSA are made into paclitaxel-bound albumin nanoparticles by a high-pressure homogenization technique. After injection of paclitaxel (albumin-binding) into the blood, it rapidly disintegrates and disperses into a smaller albumin-paclitaxel complex, which binds and activates the gp60 albumin receptor on vascular endothelial cells, interacts with Caveolin on the cell membrane, and then is transported to the tumor intercellular substance by transcytosis. Tumor cells can secrete a SPARC protein with a specific affinity for albumin, which actively captures the albumin-paclitaxel complex in the tumor stroma and accumulates around the tumor cells. Since tumor neovascular endothelial cells highly express gp60 receptor and the SPARC protein is also highly expressed in the tumor region, the special transport mechanism of ""gp60- Caveolin / caveola -SPARC protein"" makes the paclitaxel for injection (albumin binding) have unique targeting and penetrating properties toward tumor tissues, hence the drug is highly concentrated in the tumor tissue, which can better increase the therapeutic effect and reduce the damage to normal tissues.||Paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding type) has the following advantages: (1) it is unnecessary to pre-administer anti-allergic drugs, the infusion time is within 30 min, and patients have good compliance; (2) due to its higher safety, the dosage can be given as high as 260-300 mg/m2; (3) it makes full use of gp60 / cysteine acid secretory protein (SPARC protein) channel to make the drug enrich toward the tumor area, and the effect is good; (4) as the dosage is within 80 ~ 300 mg/m2, the AUC increase proportionally with the administered dose, ]the body is linearly metabolized., the half-life period does not prolong with the dose, and the clinical medication is safe and controllable. Currently, the drug has been approved for breast cancer treatment in China; approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for breast cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer treatment; approved for gastric cancer treatment in Japan; and NCCN guidelines recommend it for the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer, and cervical cancer.||In summary, based on the biological advantages of albumin-binding paclitaxel such as high-distribution, high-dose, high-efficiency, and low-toxicity, the reported good clinical benefit and safety for hepatobiliary and malignant tumors, and the limited data about albumin-bound paclitaxel + oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment for advanced hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancies, especially in Chinese patients, our center believes that is feasible and necessary to explore the effectiveness and safety of paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding) combined with oxaliplatin as the first-line drugs for treatment of advanced oxaliplatin-based malignant tumors.||2 Purposes To evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel (albumin-bound) combined with oxaliplatin as the first-line drugs for treatment of advanced hepatobiliary and malignant tumors.||Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS) Secondary study endpoints: disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and incidence and severity of adverse events (AE).||3 Research plan 3.1 Research Design This study was a single-center, one-arm, phase II/III clinical trial, which plans to recruit 57 patients."

However, despite physicians' attempts to characterize features concerning for malignancy, it is difficult to determine the likelihood of malignancy with conventional imaging techniques, and an accurate and non-invasive test to identify malignant IPMN is needed. Our hypothesis is that positron emission tomography (PET), a three-dimensional imaging that can identify cancer cells through their increased use of sugars, may be a superior test for differentiating between benign and malignant IPMN lesions.

Advantages of FDG are its uptake in many different human tumors, its short half-life (110 minutes) and the possibility to monitor its effect closely with the FDG-PET scan. The rationale for using high doses of this radiopharmaceutical agent for treatement is that most malignant lesions have accentuated glucose metabolism, which is mirrored by increased uptake of FDG. Since FDG cannot be metabolized within the cell like glucose, it is effectively confined within the cancer cells; thus, FDG treatment is potentially a novel form of targeted therapy for tumors with increased FDG uptake."

This drug has been used in other research studies, and information from those other research studies suggests that MK-2206 may help to slow or stop the growth of malignant gliomas. In addition, MK-2206 has the capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a separation of circulating blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the central nervous system (CNS); and although it serves as a protective barrier, it can often interfere with potentially beneficial treatments reaching the brain successfully. Therefore, the investigators hope that because MK-2206 can successfully cross the blood-brain barrier, it will be more effective in patients. The purpose of this study is to see how well MK-2206 works in patients with malignant gliomas and will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 and Part 2.||Part 1 of the study will investigate the effects of MK-2206 on Akt signaling in tumor tissue.

Pre-clinical studies have shown that treatment with magrolimab leads to prolonged survival in models of Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors (ATRT), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), high-grade glioma (adult and pediatric), medulloblastoma, and embryonal tumors formerly called Primitive Neuro-Ectodermal Tumors (PNET). Safety studies in humans have proven that magrolimab has an excellent safety profile. Ongoing studies are currently testing magrolimab in adult myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal, ovarian, and bladder cancers. Herein we propose to test the safety of magrolimab in children and adults with recurrent or progressive malignant brain tumors."

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic factor which increases endothelial permeability. It plays a central role in many tumors of epithelial origin.

Glutaminase converts an amino acid (building block of proteins) called glutamine to glutamate, which can support several cellular pathways. Telaglenastat hydrochloride works by blocking glutamine activity needed for the growth of cells. When this activity is blocked, the growth of cancer cells may stop and the cancer cells may then die. Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to genes that control the way cells function and uncontrolled cell growth may result in tumor formation. Specific genetic mutations studied in this clinical trial are NF1 mutation for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and NF1, KEAP1/NRF2, or STK11/LKB1 mutation for other solid tumors.

For advanced malignant tumors of the biliary tract, the existing treatment methods are very limited and the effective rate is low. At present, gemcitabine combined with platinum therapy is the first-line standard treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer. In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has made huge breakthroughs. There are also research attempts in advanced biliary tract cancer. A study published in the international top medical journal NEJM in 2015 showed that PD-1 monoclonal antibody treatment has mismatch gene repair defects. Patients with advanced biliary tract tumors have a higher curative effect. It suggests that PD-1 monoclonal antibody is worthy of in-depth study in the treatment of biliary tract tumors.||In the previous clinical studies of PD-1 in the treatment of biliary tract tumors conducted by our center, it was observed that the tumor control of some patients was stable with the combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy. In view of the observations in the clinical research of our unit, relevant case reports, and the mechanism of the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy, we speculate that in patients with biliary tract cancer, radiotherapy and immunotherapy have a certain combined sensitization effect. Therefore, it is planned to carry out clinical research on the second-line treatment of advanced biliary tract cancer with radiotherapy and immunotherapy.||This study will explore the effectiveness and safety of tislelizumab combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of patients with advanced biliary malignant tumors (BTC) in second-line and above, with a view to improving the therapeutic effect of biliary tract tumors."

The discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses is central to decisions regarding clinical management and surgical planning in such patients. Patients with malignant tumours should be referred to a gynaecological oncologist, as the quality of cytoreductive surgery and surgical staging/lymph node dissection are important prognostic factors in ovarian cancer. These specialized surgical procedures require the specific skills and experience provided by gynaecologic oncology surgeons. Furthermore, appropriate and timely referral to a gynaecologic oncologist has been proven to increase survival in patients with ovarian cancer.Conversely, patients believed to have a benign mass requiring surgery are able to have this performed by a general gynaecologist. A standardized method for preoperative identification of probable malignant masses would allow optimization of first-line treatment for women with ovarian cancer. A risk of malignancy index would be valuable for the selective referral of relevant patients to specialized oncology centres. Currently, clinical examination, ultrasound assessment, and assays of tumour markers are part of the standard work-up for an adnexal mass. Although none of these indicators alone is very sensitive or specific for detecting malignancy, an index developed by Jacobs et al. incorporates information about the patient's menopausal status and serum Cancer antigen A-125 levels, and ultrasound characteristics of the mass to predict the risk of malignancy with greater sensitivity and specificity than any one factor alone.Some of the potential advantages of risk malignant index include rapid triage of patients through the referral system and fewer operations for benign masses being performed by gynaecologic oncologists."

Currently, the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI), with a cut-off value of 200, is often used in the Netherlands to select patients with an increased risk of ovarian cancer that should be referred to an oncologic center. However sensitivity and specificity of the RMI-score are far from optimal. Around 40% of the referred patients have benign disease in final pathological examination. Therefore, other models have been developed, such as the IOTA (International Ovarian Tumor Analysis) consortium algorithms, but these models require training, expertise and are subjective. To determine the nature of an ovarian tumor, histological examination is the golden standard. However, a pre-operative biopsy of an ovarian tumor is undesirable because of the risk of spill of tumor cells in the abdominal cavity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for non-invasive diagnostic tools to determine the nature of an ovarian tumor pre-operatively. Liquid biopsies could be such a non-invasive tool. Currently, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) circulating tumor cells (CTC), microRNA (miRNA) and tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) are available and can function as a potential blood-based biosource for (early) cancer diagnostics. Previous studies show promising results of liquid biopsies are used in (early) detection of cancer, also for ovarian cancer.||Therefore, a diagnostic algorithm will be developed using ct-DNA and TEPs as liquid biomarkers in combination with the existing ultrasound models (RMI and IOTA-models) and tumor markers (CA125 and HE4) to differentiate between early ovarian cancer and benign ovarian tumors pre-operatively.||Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness.

Loss of the surface receptor causes the tumor cells to die in a process called apoptosis. As the tumor cells die, they release small particles called exosomes, each full of tumor antigens. It is believed that these exosomes as well as the presence of the antisense molecule work together to activate the immune system against the tumor as they slowly diffuse out of the chamber. This combination product therefore serves as a slow-release antigen depot. Immune cells are immediately available for activation outside of the chamber because a wound was created to implant these tumor cells and a foreign body (the chamber) is present in the wound. The wound and the chamber fortify the initial immune response which eventually leads to the activation of immune system T cells that attack and eliminate the tumor. By training the immune system to recognize the tumor, the patient is also protected through immune surveillance from later tumor growth should the tumor recur. Compared to the other immunotherapy strategies, this treatment marshalls the native immune system (specifically the antigen presenting cells, or dendritic cells) rather than engineering the differentiation of these immune cells and re-injecting them. Compared to traditional treatment alternatives for tumor recurrence, including a boost of further radiation and more chemotherapy, this treatment represents potentially greater benefit with fewer risks.||This combination product serves as a therapeutic vaccine with an acceptable safety profile, which activates an anti-tumor adaptive immune response resulting in radiographic tumor regression."

None of the 46 participants developed a local recurrence.||Based on information we have learned from research studies, we recommend whole breast radiation therapy for women with malignant and borderline phyllodes tumors after they receive a lumpectomy.||New methods for delivering breast radiotherapy are being developed that allow radiation to be delivered solely to the site of the surgical resection. This is called partial breast radiation. The main advantage of partial breast radiation is that it simplifies treatment for the patient. Radiation is delivered twice a day for 5 days, rather than 5 days per week for 6 weeks. The main concern is that partial breast radiation might miss other sites of breast cancer in the breast receiving the radiation.||Evidence is accumulating from research studies that partial breast radiation therapy after surgical removal of the more common type of breast cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma, the breast results in rates of local recurrence that are comparable to those seen after whole breast radiation therapy.||In contrast to patients with invasive ductal cancers of the breast, it is very rare for patients to have phyllodes tumors that appear in more than one area of the breast. Review of research data determined that cancer recurrences seen in patients with phyllodes tumors that had undergone lumpectomies were almost always at the original tumor site. Therefore, partial breast radiation is likely to be as effective as whole breast radiation therapy after resection of malignant phyllodes tumors.||The purpose of the study is to determine what the chances are that a phyllodes tumor will recur in the breast when the breast is treated with partial breast radiation therapy after a lumpectomy."

Recently, self-expandable metal stents(SEMS) have been suggested as an alternative to surgery and effectively decompress the colonic obstruction and allow for bowel preparation and elective surgery. Theoretically, SEMSs are classified into uncovered stents and covered stents. Covered stents have the advantage of less frequent stent occlusion by tumor in-growth and the disadvantage of a high risk of stent migration, whereas uncovered stents are associated with less stent migration, although they appear to be more prone to tumor ingrowth.

With certain modifications, it is intended to reproduce the safety results of the recurrent glioma previous trials as well as explore any objective clinical responses in newly diagnosed patients. Protocol 14379-101 is closed to accrual and Abbreviated Clinical Report is prepared for FDA submission. The safety profile for this protocol was quite favorable.||This treatment involves taking the patient's own tumor cells at surgery, treating them with an investigational new drug (an antisense molecule) designed to shut down a targeted surface receptor protein, and re-implanting the cells, now encapsulated in small diffusion chambers the size of a nickel in the patient's abdomen within 24 hours after the surgery. Loss of the surface receptor causes the tumor cells to die in a process called apoptosis. As the tumor cells die, they release small particles called exosomes, each full of tumor antigens. The investigators believe that these exosomes as well as the presence of the antisense molecule work together to activate the immune system against the tumor as they slowly diffuse out of the chamber. Immune cells are immediately available for activation outside of the chamber because a wound was created to implant these tumor cells and a foreign body (the chamber) is present in the wound. In this trial, a dose escalation of the therapeutic agent will involve an increase in both biodiffusion chamber number as well as the time the biodiffusion chambers remain implanted. The wound and the chamber fortify the initial immune response which eventually leads to the activation of immune system T cells that attack and eliminate the tumor. By training the immune system to recognize the tumor, the patient is also protected through immune surveillance from later tumor growth should the tumor recur. Compared to treatment alternatives for tumor recurrence, including a boost of further radiation and more chemotherapy, this treatment represents potentially greater benefit with fewer risks."

Helical chest computed tomography (CT) is the standard method of excluding pulmonary metastases. However, CT lacks molecular information regarding nodule histology and often biopsy is required to exclude malignancy. Biopsy procedures carry known risks including those associated with anesthesia and sedation, infection, pneumothorax, hemorrhage, pain and other post-procedure and post-operative complications and may also add unnecessary cost to the management of the patient. We found that the ability of three experienced pediatric radiologists to correctly predict nodule histology based on CT imaging features was limited (57% to 67% rate of correct classification). Also, there was only slight to moderate agreement in nodule classification between these reviewers.||Furthermore, of 50 children who have undergone pulmonary nodule biopsy at St. Jude in the last five years, 44% (22/50) had only benign nodules.||Adult studies have shown that a nuclear medicine scan called fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and the fusion modality PET-CT are superior to diagnostic CT in distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules because FDG PET gives information about the metabolic activity of the nodule.

Despite aggressive therapy, less than 40% of these patients are expected to live beyond 5 years. The radiologic imaging of these tumors relies on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - these studies provide good anatomical information about the size and location of the tumor, but are unable to evaluate whether the tumor is still viable or contains metabolic activity, after surgery and, in particular, radiotherapy (RT). This complicates accurate understanding of the status of the tumor during a patient's follow-up. This study proposes to add magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a non-invasive imaging method which can monitor metabolic changes in the tumor, to regular imaging. Understanding the changes that occur in a tumor over the course of radiotherapy could help predict how well a treatment might work, and could also be useful in distinguishing a return of the tumor in an area of radiation damage before it would be obvious on regular imaging."

These tumors are characterized by diverse molecular abnormalities (within the same tumor), which, along with the difficulties of many standard chemotherapies crossing the blood barrier, contribute to the very poor response to therapy and poor survival.||We recently showed that Dichloroacetate (DCA, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) was able to depolarize cancer (but not normal) mitochondria and induce apoptosis in cancer but not normal tissues. We believe that altering the metabolism of cancers like glioblastoma (DCA switches metabolism from the cytoplasmic glycolysis to the mitochondrial glucose oxidation) we inhibit the resistance to apoptosis that characterizes cancer. Because metabolism (i.e. glycolysis) is the end result of many and diverse molecular pathways, the effects of DCA might be positive in cancers with diverse molecular backgrounds. DCA is also a very small molecule that readily crosses the blood brain barrier. Therefore we hypothesize that DCA will be an effective and relative non-toxic potential therapy for malignant gliomas.||We are conducting a phase II trial with 2 parallel arms: a) patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas and b) patients with recurrent gliomas or gliomas that have failed standard therapy (which includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy). All patients need to have a histological diagnosis. DCA will be given orally and patients will be followed for a minimum of 6 months. The tumor size will be followed by standard MRI or CT criteria and glucose uptake (a direct effect of DCA on the tumor) will be measured by FDG-PET imaging. Several clinical parameters and quality of life will be followed. Potential toxicity (particularly peripheral neuropathy) will be closely followed and dose-de-escalation protocols are in place in case of toxicity. In addition, escape protocols for the application of standard therapy (when appropriate) are in place in patients with no evidence of response to DCA. In vitro studies will be performed in the tissues obtained at the time of surgery (where appropriate) and correlated prospectively with clinical data.||There is limited ability to accept patients outside of Alberta; this is in part because the visit and testing schedule is intense, requiring residence in Edmonton for at least 6 months."

Furthermore, we uncovered that P2RX7 controls homeostasis, survival and function of regulatory T cells (Hubert et al., 2010). In addition, our recent demonstration that P2RX7 deficiency lowered mucosal inflammation but unexpectedly enhanced tumor formation in vivo warrants additional efforts to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms accounting for this effect and suggest that enhancing P2RX7 function may have an anti-tumor therapeutic effect.||These observations emphasize the tumor suppressor role of P2X7 receptor, warrant further investigation to better understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for this anti-tumor effect and suggest that enhancing the function of P2X7R could have a therapeutic effect significant antitumor.||Our main objectives is to explore the role of P2RX7 in healthy, inflammatory and cancerous colonic mucosa.

Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), the father of modern pathology, first pointed out the resemblance between the biological behavior of cancer cells and that of single-celled organisms when causing infections. He thought, incorrectly, that cancer cells were cells infected with bacteria and had acquired their pathogenic behavior from them. Others later postulated that the behavior of cancer cells was likely due to the re-expression of past traits and behaviors (atavism) derived from their past evolutionary experience as independent, single-celled organisms from which all cells in multicellular organisms originated. In other words, the behavior of pathogenic unicellular organisms, including: unlimited replicative potential; capacity for invasion, migration, and metastases; abilities to evade the host's immune system, to generate multi-drug resistance; and to kill a host, are what the investigators define as ""cancer"" when one of the investigators cells re-express these past ancestral traits.

The therapeutic monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab (Avastin®) inhibits the VEGF pathway by binding the VEGF ligand. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) this treatment reduces contrast enhancement by restoring both, the blood-brain-barrier and the destabilized vessel integrity.

There are currently few cases published involving the use of PDT in infratentorial (in the posterior fossa) brain tumors in general and specifically those occurring in children. The investigators propose to test a technique, for the first time in the U.S., that demonstrated in Australian adult glioblastoma patients dramatic long-term, survival rates of 57% (anaplastic astrocytoma) and 37% (glioblastoma multiforme). These results are unprecedented in any other treatment protocol.||Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a paradigm shift in the treatment of tumors from the traditional resection and systemic chemotherapy methods. The principle behind photodynamic therapy is light-mediated activation of a photosensitizer that is selectively accumulated in the target tissue, causing tumor cell destruction through singlet oxygen production. Therefore, the photosensitizer is considered to be the first critical element in PDT procedures, and the activation procedure is the second step. The methodology used in this proposal utilizes more intensive laser light and larger Photofrin photosensitizer doses than prior PDT protocols in the U.S. for brain tumor patients. The PDT will consist of photoillumination at 630 nm beginning at the center of the tumor resection cavity, and delivering a total energy of 240 J cm-2. The investigators feel that the light should penetrate far enough into the tissue to reach migrating tumor cells, and destroy these cells without harming the healthy cells in which they are dispersed.||The investigators will be testing the hypothesis that pediatric subjects with progressive/recurrent malignant brain tumors undergoing PDT with increased doses of Photofrin® and light energy than were used in our previous clinical study will show better progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes.

Previous attempts to improve response to therapy by increasing the oxygen level of tissues have had disappointing results and collectively have not led to changing clinical practice. Without a method to measure oxygen levels in tumors or the ability to monitor over time whether tumors are responding to methods to increase oxygen during therapy, clinician's reluctance to use oxygen therapy in usual practice is not surprising.||The hypothesis underlying this research is that repeated measurements of tissue oxygen levels can be used to optimize cancer therapy, including combined therapy, and to minimize normal tissue side effects or complications. Because studies have found that tumors vary both in their initial levels of oxygen and exhibit changing patterns during growth and treatment, we propose to monitor oxygen levels in tumors and their responsiveness to hyperoxygenation procedures. Such knowledge about oxygen levels in tumor tissues and their responsiveness to hyper-oxygenation could potentially be used to select subjects for particular types of treatment, or otherwise to adjust routine care for patients known to have hypoxic but unresponsive tumors in order to improve their outcomes.||The overall objectives of this study are to establish the clinical feasibility and efficacy of using in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry-a technique related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-to obtain direct and repeated measurements of clinically useful information about tumor tissue oxygenation in specific groups of subjects with the same types of tumors, and to establish the clinical feasibility and efficacy of using inhalation of enriched oxygen to gain additional clinically useful information about responsiveness of tumors to hyper-oxygenation. Two devices are used: a paramagnetic charcoal suspension (Carlo Erba India ink) and in vivo EPR oximetry to assess oxygen levels. The ink is injected and becomes permanent in the tissue at the site of injection unless removed; thereafter, the in vivo oximetry measurements are noninvasive and can be repeated indefinitely."

One of the most widely used preclinical models is conventional cell lines, such as the NCI-60 panel of cell lines;these cell lines are widely used in preclinical testing for novel targeted drugs, partially owing to the low expense and reduced labor associated with cell culture compared with other preclinical models, such as animal xenografts. However, recent studies have shown that accumulation of genetic aberrations in cancer cell lines occurs with increasing passage number. These models also lack the heterogeneity of tumors and do not exhibit a proper microenvironment, highlighting the limitations of cell-based models. Consistent with this, Johnson et al. demonstrated that in vivo activities of the cell lines within the NCI-60 panel did not closely correlate with corresponding human cancers.||Therefore, to better preserve the genomic integrity and tumor heterogeneity observed in patients, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are being used more frequently. PDX is generated by directly transplanting freshly resected patient tumors into immunocompromised murine hosts with or without an intermediate in vitro culture step. This PDX model is an improvement over cell lines because it can provide both an appropriate tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity of tumor cells. However, the engraftment success rates and growth rates of implanted tumors are highly variable depending on the tumor type, possibly due to insufficient numbers of hematopoietic cells and/or ineffective microenvironmental cues in the mouse stroma. The extent to which tumor cells from freshly resected tumors are able to withstand mechanical stresses and xenotransplantation barriers is also unclear. Furthermore, the use of PDX models for application in clinical oncology is limited owing to the time required for PDX establishment (> 4 months) since most patients with refractory cancer live less than 1 year. Recently, PDC line models have been suggested as an alternative preclinical model to be used as a prediction tool for preclinical drug sensitivity.||Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to overcome these potential barriers of pre-existing models by examining the capacity of PDC line models to recapitulate the histological and genomic features of primary patient tumors. In selected cases, the investigators screened drug sensitivity in vitro using PDC lines and compared the results with real-life clinical treatment outcomes."

Targeted radiation therapy such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy or pencil beam scanning uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed, cisplatin, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving targeted radiation therapy in addition to surgery and chemotherapy may work better than surgery and chemotherapy alone for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma."

We believe that tumor cells from the melanoma first move through the lymphatic system (a system of clear fluid that moves around the body and carries white blood cells, much like the blood system) to a lymph node in an orderly way. If we can identify the first lymph nodes to receive a tumor cell, this can be removed and examined. We currently use one drug, called ""technetium-99m sulfur colloid"" which can detect about 90% of the first lymph nodes that the tumor cells would move to. Technetium-99m is a radioactive compound and can be detected through the skin by a special instrument that reads radioactivity. As part of this research, we would like to use a second drug called ""fluorescein"" (Fluorescite®) to see if it will identify the same lymph nodes or additional ones and examine these. This drug is fluorescent and can be detected even through the skin using a blue light. This drug is approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to for injection in the vein as a diagnostic aid and has been safely used in people for many years. In this study, we will be injecting it under the skin, which is a different use from how it is currently approved by the FDA. In the past another drug has been used, called ""isosulfan blue"" (Lymphazurin®), but availability of this drug is currently limited, and it has higher risks associated with it.||This study is being conducted by Dr. Robert Andtbacka, Dr. Dirk Noyes, Dr. James McGreevy and at University of Utah. This study is a Phase I/II and is done to find out if the drug can be used safely when given under the skin and if it will work for this purpose."
